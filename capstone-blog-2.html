                <p>Following up from last post, my group for the international student experience story has began recording audio and video for our interviews. We have set our selves up in a small green screen room to record. We chose the green screen room because the audio is pretty good and the green screen gives us a consistent background when recording. We have also obtained media release forms for the interviewees. Additionally we decreased the amount of interviews we hoped to capture from 12-16 to around 10. We made this cut due to the time we have left for editing and recording. </p>

                <p>Currently in my personal project I have put together three songs to create an EP. These songs I have classified as ambient synth-wave. Figuring out what I wanted to create was definitely a challenge for me as I have many ideas but struggle to execute them. Coming very soon I will work on the disc covers as well as the album cover. I have a profile picture I would like to use, I just have to find it. Each of the disc covers as well as my PFP will be created using illustrator. I’m not sure right now what I will make for the album cover. I would like it to be a photo though. 
               </p>

               <p>
                The song titles so far are:
                <li>Growde</li>
                <li>Vintap</li>
                <li>Spunnk</li>
              </p>

                <p>When writing or designing media both authors and designers must find a way to make a personal connection with the consumer, that way they are more likely to continue using that source of info or product. The designer is somewhat of a messenger in that if an event were to happen, they must it clear to the public what happened in the most open way possible. you may see that depending on the perspective visuals and explanations may differ from others. There really is no perfect way to depict something.  </p>

                <p>I do not believe we are in a 'post multi-media' generation. Multi-media is still a very important set of systems of which we get our information world wide. I believe that designers are one of the most important 'messengers' of that information because we are a very visually stimulated generation.  </p>

                <p>We have slightly strayed away from text media to more visual media. pretty much everyone has a phone or a device that they can browse the internet and social media sites with. we see massive billboards in cities as we commute and every one at some point or another has seen graffiti somewhere. Graffiti takes designing and event though it is often text there are certain stylistic aspects to it that communicate underlying messages. </p>

                <p>I agree with the manifesto. graphic designers have been singled out and put into the category of advertising. it is not a designers job to advertise, although it may be in today's day in age, a big part of what they do, it should not be the only thing they do. </p>

                <p>Graphic design is an art that is often suffocated by huge corporations looking to get a message across to the consumer. Unfortunately, "the market rewards it" and designers don't have much of a choice. maxbruinsma,  fall 1999 / spring 2000, by Chris Dixon, Adbusters, Rick Poynor.</p>

          <p>Hey, I am Marshal Latham. I am a 18 year old who has a terrible sleeping schedule and is not super great at
            time management. However, I do have a few hobbies that I can spend many hours at a time in, and I hope the MMC
            course will help strengthen them. I enjoy creating digital and non digital art, I love painting, composing
            music, and sketching cartoons.
