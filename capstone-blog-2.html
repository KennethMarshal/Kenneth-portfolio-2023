                <p>Following up from last post, my group for the international student experience story has began recording audio and video for our interviews. We have set our selves up in a small green screen room to record. We chose the green screen room because the audio is pretty good and the green screen gives us a consistent background when recording. We have also obtained media release forms for the interviewees. Additionally we decreased the amount of interviews we hoped to capture from 12-16 to around 10. We made this cut due to the time we have left for editing and recording. </p>

                <p>Currently in my personal project I have put together three songs to create an EP. These songs I have classified as ambient synth-wave. Figuring out what I wanted to create was definitely a challenge for me as I have many ideas but struggle to execute them. Coming very soon I will work on the disc covers as well as the album cover. I have a profile picture I would like to use, I just have to find it. Each of the disc covers as well as my PFP will be created using illustrator. I’m not sure right now what I will make for the album cover. I would like it to be a photo though. 
               </p>

               <p>
                The song titles so far are:
                <li>Growde</li>
                <li>Vintap</li>
                <li>Spunnk</li>
              </p>

                <p>As for the website, I still need to transfer over some content and smooth out the visuals. Other than that, there isn’t really much going on there.</p>

          <p>Hey, I am Marshal Latham. I am a 18 year old who has a terrible sleeping schedule and is not super great at
            time management. However, I do have a few hobbies that I can spend many hours at a time in, and I hope the MMC
            course will help strengthen them. I enjoy creating digital and non digital art, I love painting, composing
            music, and sketching cartoons.
