                <h1>Designers and Authors</h1>
                <h2>Who are they?</h2>

                <p>Designers are authors. They paint stories through images and media that they create. A designers job is to pass along information from a source too the consumer, that is to say that if a company wanted an ad about boots, the designer must write a visual story making those boots appeal to the most amount of people in the best way possible, and must depict the boots as being the best boots, far better than the competition. An author does this similarly when writing blogs, books, or magazines. </p>

                <p>If a non fiction author had the task of writing a biography of a historical figure, they need to show that person in a detailed enough way that the reader can get the most, positively and negatively, out of the biography. magazines are kind of a mid point between author and designers because not only does one have to write content, the other must accompany thee content with images or graphics that support the ideas portrayed, or vice versa. </p>

                <p>/* Quote Goes Here */</p>

                <p>When writing or designing media both authors and designers must find a way to make a personal connection with the consumer, that way they are more likely to continue using that source of info or product. The designer is somewhat of a messenger in that if an event were to happen, they must it clear to the public what happened in the most open way possible. you may see that depending on the perspective visuals and explanations may differ from others. There really is no perfect way to depict something.  </p>

                <p>I do not believe we are in a 'post multi-media' generation. Multi-media is still a very important set of systems of which we get our information world wide. I believe that designers are one of the most important 'messengers' of that information because we are a very visually stimulated generation.  </p>

                <p>We have slightly strayed away from text media to more visual media. pretty much everyone has a phone or a device that they can browse the internet and social media sites with. we see massive billboards in cities as we commute and every one at some point or another has seen graffiti somewhere. Graffiti takes designing and event though it is often text there are certain stylistic aspects to it that communicate underlying messages. </p>

                <p>I agree with the manifesto. graphic designers have been singled out and put into the category of advertising. it is not a designers job to advertise, although it may be in today's day in age, a big part of what they do, it should not be the only thing they do. </p>

                <p>Graphic design is an art that is often suffocated by huge corporations looking to get a message across to the consumer. Unfortunately, "the market rewards it" and designers don't have much of a choice. maxbruinsma,  fall 1999 / spring 2000, by Chris Dixon, Adbusters, Rick Poynor.</p>
